		<h2> About QBnB </h2>
		<p> This QBnB website was created by three Computer Engineering students, Patrick Dang-Ho,
			Jordan McGregor and Matthew Sims. The purpose of this website is to 
			decrease the barrier of entry relating to Queen's Alumni having to 
			find a place to stay when they come back to visit. It allows members 
			to post when they have open rooms around the Queen's area as well as allowing
			members to book these rooms. We currently take no profit in any of the sales.
