PHP Notes
PHP code is written in the html document. It is inserted between <?php and ?> tags
However, a HTML document with PHP in it is not a .html file, rather the filename is terminated with .php
PHP is run of the server so it is not limited to what the client can access like the way javascript is

Concatenation Operator: In php you can just type a whole string like (echo "Hello, World";) or you can use the concatenation operator like (echo "Hello" . " " . "World";)
This is the same as the plus sign (+) in javascript

In additon to outputing strings PHP can also output numbers and computer arithmetic operations e.g echo 8 * 3

Variables: Variables can be stored in PHP by using a dollar sign followed by the name e.g $favouriteSinger = 'Beyonce'; It seems that variables in PHP are dynamically typed.

Arrays: They intialized as follows $array = array("first", "second"); They also indexed at 0 :-)
They can accessed using [] or {}
You can remove an element by doing "unset($array[2]);" or delete the whole array by doing "unset($array);"
Arrays in PHP are not static in size. The code "array_push($array, value)" adds a value to the end of the specified array
You can print the number of elements in the array via "count($array);"

For loops: same as always

For each: Here's an example:
	given an array $languages...
	foreach ($languages as $lang){
		echo $lang;
	}

Random: You can specify a random item by using the syntax $randomvariable = rand(0, 1, 2, 3) //this picks a number between and including 0 to 3
or you can do rand(MINval, MAXval);

In php you can add html tags to the dom like: echo "<div class=\"coin\">H</div>"; where .coin is a class 

You can also print out php variables by calling the normally except with {} around them e.g {myvariable}

While loops: same as always

String length: check the length of a string by $lengthOfAString = strlen($astring);

Substring: substr(thestring, startingIndex, lengthOfPartialString);
some other stirng methods include strtoupper and 
strpos("string", "characheryourlookingfor");

round: e.g round(a decimal);

sorting: to sort an array in PHP you "sort($array)". the default is to sort in ascending order. use rsort to sort in descending order. 

printing an array: to print an array "print join("a delimeter", $array);" this prints out the array with each element seperated by the specified delimeter

functions can be defined like:
	function functionName(){
		//do stuff
	}
then called:
	functionName();
you can also return a value from a function as well by including "return aValue" in your function

Objects: here's an example for future reference:
class Person {
// Creating some properties (variables tied to an object)
public $isAlive = true;
public $firstname;
public $lastname;
public $age;

// Assigning the values
public function __construct($firstname, $lastname, $age) {
  $this->firstname = $firstname;
  $this->lastname = $lastname;
  $this->age = $age;
}

// Creating a method (function tied to an object)
public function greet() {
  return "Hello, my name is " . $this->firstname . " " . $this->lastname . ". Nice to meet you! :-)";
}
}

// Creating a new person called "boring 12345", who is 12345 years old ;-)
$me = new Person('boring', '12345', 12345);

// Printing out, what the greet method returns
echo $me->greet(); 


3 functions to interact with objects in php:
	is_a($var, "Objectnameinquotes"): boolean check to see if a variable is an instance of a class
	property_exists($var, "propertynameisquotes"): boolean check to see if a variable has a certain property
	method_exists(): you get the idea


Associative Arrays a.k.a Dictionaries: 
		$myArray = array(2012, 'blue', 5);

        // ...and this is an associative array:
        $myAssocArray = array('year' => 2012,
                        'colour' => 'blue',
                        'doors' => 5);
            
        // This code will output "blue"...
        echo $myArray[1];
        echo '<br />';
            
        // ... and this will also output "blue"!
        echo $myAssocArray['colour'];
